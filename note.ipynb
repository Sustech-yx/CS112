    "Von Neumann machine: Both instructions and data are stored in memory in binary form, such as *memory*, and instructions are executed according to the order in which they are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine code: `100111100001111000101110_100111100111100001101100_100110000000110000010000_\n",

    "The machine code in binary form is clear to the machine, and the machine can execute the code according to the predetermined logic according to the machine code. But such language is obscure to human beings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assembly language: The concept of assembly is introduced. Assembly is a low-level language. It uses mnemonics (add, mov, bne, etc.) to replace the opcodes in machine instructions, and addresses or flags to replace the addresses of instructions and operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notice**: Different computer architectures have different instruction sets. This means that their assembly code specifications are different. Developers have adopted different ideas. `Java` introduces the mechanism of JVM virtual machine, so that its code can realize cross platform; The open source community provides many cross compilation tools for people to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the low-level language, the high-level language comes next. High level languages are mainly divided into two categories: **interpreted** and **compiled**. Compiled languages are represented by Java, C, etc. Interpretative languages include **Python**, R, and so on. Compiled languages have a remarkable feature. They need to go through complex steps of source code (will be introduced in CS323 Compile Principle). This means that **the code cannot be changed and run at any time**. Explanatory language has natural advantages in this respect. In addition, interpreted languages have a natural cross platform feature, because they do not involve the conversion of assembly code, so they are **not limited by computer platforms**. However, the interpreted language also has a fatal flaw, that is, in general, its running **efficiency is far lower** than that of the compiled language. Last but not least. Interpreted language is relatively easy to master. Fortunately, this will be the first programming language you know. Hava fun！\n",
